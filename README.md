# DAVAR-Lab-ML
DAVAR-Lab-ML is a repository of machine learning algorithms from Davar Lab. The researches of this repository have included/will include knowledge distillation, semi-supervised learning, active learning, incremental learning, learning with noisy labels and so on.

## Features

- **Extensibility**: The algorithms are well suited for *MM-series* repository, e.g., MMDetection, MMClassfication...
- **Plug-and-Play**: The modules or operations are easily incorporated with different deep learning tasks, e.g., image classification, object detection, image segmentations...
- **Easy-to-Use**: The algorithms in this repository are well tested, and they can be easily run in your machines.
